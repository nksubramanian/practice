# Looping through Dictionary

There are several ways of looping through Dictionary and some are shown below

1)The keys in the dictionary could be obtained using the below program

Sheela = { "Major": "Chemistry", "Age": 21, "Gender": "Female", "Qualification":"Bachelor" }\
for x in Sheela:\
  print(x)
  
2) When the keys could be obatained as shown above, values too could be obtained using the below
 
 Sheela = { "Major": "Chemistry", "Age": 21, "Gender": "Female", "Qualification":"Bachelor" }\
for x in Sheela:\
  print(Sheela[x])

 3) Keys in a dictionary could also be looped over using .keys()

Sheela = { "Major": "Chemistry", "Age": 21, "Gender": "Female", "Qualification":"Bachelor" }\
for x in Sheela.keys():
  print(x)

 4) Similarly, Values in the dictionary could also be looped as 

Sheela = { "Major": "Chemistry", "Age": 21, "Gender": "Female", "Qualification":"Bachelor" }\
for x in Sheela.values():
  print(x)
