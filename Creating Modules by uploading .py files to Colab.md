# Creating Modules

Modules provide the option of storing a group of functions together. This helps in the organization of code and reusability. 

### Step 1

First step in creating module is to store the related functions in .py file. The name of the module would have to be same as name of .py file

The file created would be in the working directory and you can download the file for further use in a different program

### Step 2

The second step is to have the file in the working directory. You can upload the .py file that contains method

To know the working directory, you could use the pwd() command

If you have not created .py yourself, you can download one from here

### Step 3

After placing the module .py folder in the working directory

```python
import tester
tester.add(3,4)
```
