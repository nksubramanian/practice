# if else

The if else statement is a slightly more advanced version of the if statement. 

Here, the condition is first checked for True or False. 

If found to be True, the statements in the if block gets executed. 

If found to be false, the statement in the else block gets executed.

# Syntax

```python
if condition:
  statement
else:
  statement
```

In the "if else" statement, one block of statement is sure to get executed. Either the if block gets executed or else block gets executed.

Here is a program to check if a number is odd or even

```python

num=4
if num>0:
  print("The number is greater than 0")
else:
  print("The number is 0 or less than 0")

```
