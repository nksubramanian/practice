# Operator

Operators, for all practical purposes are functions that get a symbol for its operation. 

Operands are the data item that an operator acts on.

Operators in python are classified into the below

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators

### Arithmetic Operator

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations. 

Below table provides a summary

| Operator  | Operation   | Example |                                  
| ------------- | ----------------|--------------|
| +             | Addition        | 6+4.0             |                                          
| -             | Subtraction     | 6-4             |                                           
| *             | Multiplication  | 6\*4              | 
| /             | Division        |  6/4            | 
| %             | Modulus         |   6%4           |  
| **            | Power           |   6\*\*4           |  
| //            | Floor Division  |    6//4          |  



### Assignment Operators


| Operator  | Example   | Equivalent |                                  
| ------------- | ----------------|--------------|
| =             | y=9      | y=9           |                                          
| +=            | y+=9     | y=y+9             |                                           
| -=           | y-=9  | y=y-9             | 
| \*=            | y\*=9        |  y=y\*9            | 
| /=            | y/=9         |   y=y/9           |  
| %=            | y%=9           | y=y%9           |  
| //=          | y//=9  |    y=y//9          |  
| \*\*=          | y\*\*=9  |    y=y\*\*9          |  
|&=              | y&=9                | y=y&9                 |
|\|=              | y\|=9                | y=y\|9                 |
|>>=             | y>>=9                | y=y>>9              |
|<<=             | y<<=9                | y=y<<9                 |
