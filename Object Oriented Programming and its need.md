# Object Oriented Programming 

Pragramming is rarely done by a few individuals/organizations.

Programs are usually developed by many individuals/groups working together and thus integration of modules can be difficult.

Programs would have to maintained and modified even after their development

So it is necessary for huge programs not just to work, but also be organized well. 

These difficulties are addressed through objected oriented programming(OOP). OOP is one such paradigm for organizing code. 

Some of the features of OOPs are abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, Inheritance.


### Abstraction
Abstraction is the hiding of internal details of program and individuals can treat different parts of the code as black box.  
Abstraction could also mean imposing of common structure on various objects or as some say "blue print". 

This feature is useful when one part of the program/project is worked on by one group and another part by another group. 
In order to communicate, both groups could agree upon the specifications of the objects to be passed. 

Thus, one group could work towards producing objects of that specification and another group could work on their 
part of the project assuming objects are of the decided specification.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is putting of code and related data together, putting in a capsule so to speak. 

When programs developed are huge, it would be naturally preferable that some data items are protected and ensured they're not (inadvertently)modified by 
other part of program/project-this some consider as encapsulation while others consider as abstraction.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the feature of the function to respond/act differently based on the context

### Inheritance
Inheritance feature is used when one part of the program is to be copied to another part with some modifications.


Procedural programming can also perform these features/abstraction, but the advantage offered by Object Oriented Programming langauges 
is that these features/abstraction are made explicit.
