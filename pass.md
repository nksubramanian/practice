# pass

pass statement has no effect on the code, but neverthless has its uses. 

For example, having no code in the if block would result in a compiler error. 

This error can be circumvented by using the pass statement

```python

num=7
if num%2==0:
  pass
else:
  print("The number is odd")
 
```
