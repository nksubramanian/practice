# If

"If statement" first checks if the condition specified is true or false. 

If the condition is found to be true, then the block of statements below the condition gets processed.I

If the condition is evaluated to false, then the block gets skipped.

### Below is the syntax


```python
if condition:
  statements
```

### Here is a program that checks if a number is greater than 0

```python
num=5
if num>0:
  print("Number is greater than 0")
print("This line is always printed as it falls outside the if block.")
```
