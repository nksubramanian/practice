# while loop

In while loop, the condition gets checked first and the block within the while loop gets executed once. 

Then the condition is checked again and if found true, the block gets executed again This goes on until the condition in loop becomes false. 

If condition would never become true, then the control would always be in the loop. This infinite loop has its uses as well.

### Syntax

```python
while condition:
  statement
```

### Here is simple program to print up to "n" numbers. 

At first, "iter" variable is assigned to 1 and then condition(iter<n) is checked for. 

If the condition is true, the while block gets executed and iter variable is incremented by 1. 

Then, the condition is again checked and while block gets executed again. This goes on until the condition becomes False

```python
n=10
iter=1
while(iter<n):
  print(n)
```
